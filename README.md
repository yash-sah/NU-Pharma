purchase of medicines easier.

-> If they need any asisstance to purchase medication, we have a ChatBot to help them out.
-> Users can review each and every product before purchasing.
-> If the user requires to know the list of pharmacy within their proximity, they can avail the map feature to find the same.
-> For home delivery, users can add their address and payment methods.
